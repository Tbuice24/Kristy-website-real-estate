      <h2>Getting licensed</h2>
      <p>Follow steps on email link(Sidenote: if you cant take the pre-test without 'cheating' then do not take the real test. There is a two week waiting period before you are able to retake the test. It is okay to fail the test though, I did on my first attempt and no one cares.)<br>
        -Once the study guidelines are complete, take the test.($68.00)<br><br>
        (1st failed attemp wait two weeks to retake, 2 failed attempts wait a month to retake.)
        -Upon passing the exam, get fingerprint sent to commissioner office.
        They cannot issue your licences until they do a background check. (1-5 days for fingerprint submission)<br><br>
        -get E + O (erroes and omissions) $145 Deposit and #35/mo NAPA<br><br>
        -When NPN comes back we will start the process of getting you registered with carriers (usually a 1-2 week process)<br><br>
        -Continue to call and check on getting registered with carriers. Each company will provide you with your producer number.<br><br>
        -Pay  scale<br> 
        -Briz 2 interview<br> 
        -3 streams of income.<br><br>
        1. All agents on my team start at 100% comp. (first 9 months privms upgront 24-48 hours after the application is approved. Remaining three months will be deposited as paid)<br><br>
    2. Renewals every year (Each carrier gives a percentage 11-8% for renewals, each year the poley in good standing)<br><br>
    3. Building agencies (making money while you sleep)<br><br>
    If you would like a more detailed description watch: "Family first like agency overview" on Youtube.<br>

      <h2>While waiting for Licences to come back
        (license carriers) you need to be doing one of the following,
        if not all:<br>
      </h2>
      <p>-Pick a script to memorize and memorize it!<br><br>
        -Memorize rebuttals (Word tracks are key here, lots of psychology behind the phones/this business)<br><br>
        -Watch youtube and podcasts that are FFL or insurance related<br><br>
        -True talk podcast FFL<br><br>
        -Rapid fire objection handling with Matt Smith (FFL West Coast)<br><br>

        -Episode 83: in-home pressentation from a producer who helps 54 families a month (FFL USA)<br><br>
        -This is from a womens perspective, I mostly saw a lot of mens videos when I first started, it doesnt really matter. 
        Its all the same, but it helped me, I think for my girls it would be valuable to check out!
        She is succeeding tremendously, and worked in a gym prior to this<br><br>
        <h3>*There are a ton of videos! Find the ones that resonate with you best. These are just a few of my favorites, and you could possible see some of them again in the boot camp! I highly encourage you to re-watch videos more than once*</h3><br>
